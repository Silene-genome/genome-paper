DCJ2HP is written in Java 1.6. You do not need to install the program, on the other hand, you need
a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) 1.6 or higher. If you do not have such JVM installed onto your 
computer, please, visit <a href="http://www.sun.com">www.sun.com</a> for a free download.<br><br>

<p align="justify">
You can run the program from command line. To do so, please,
change directory to bin/, and type<br><br>

The <b>s/d</b> flag sets if <b>s</b>ingle or <b>d</b>uplicated genomes are
read. The syntheny blocks in simple genomes should be consecutively
numbered starting from 1, each line should contain one chromosome. See
<i>data/halved_ancestor.genome</i> for an example.The syntheny blocks
in duplicated genomes should be numbered with 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, etc. See
<i>data/duplicated_ancestor.genome</i> for an example.

<p align="justify">
<b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b> are the two files
containing the start and the end genome.

<p align="justify">
<b> burnin_steps</b>, <b>samples</b> and
<b>repeats_between_two_samples</b> are the number of burnin steps,
number of samples sampled after the burn-in phase of the MCMC and the
number of MCMC steps between two samples.

<p align="justify">
<b>number_of_parallel_chains</b> is the number of parallel MCMC
chains. Finally, <b>s</b> is the parameter defining the temperatures
of the chains. The inverse temperature of the k<sup>th</sup> is
defined as

<center>
1/T<sub>k</sub> = k<sup>2</sup> x s
</center>

<p align="justify">
The output of the MCMC run is written onto the standard output, which
might be pielined for further analyses.
